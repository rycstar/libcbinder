a binder library wrote in C language.

Test Environment:
    Ubuntu 16.04 with Android binder driver
    How to insmod binder driver into Ubuntu system: refer to below link:
    https://github.com/anbox/anbox-modules

Compile command:
    mkdir cmake/build -p
    cd cmake/build
    cmake ../..
    make

Run command:
    ./service_manager &
    ./led_services &
    ./led_client

Tips:
    we recommend you use the Android native library libbinder.so, it provide a tool named "AIDL" which can auto generate most of binder service and client code.
    you can refer to another repo of mine : https://github.com/rycstar/binder-linux.git
    I have verify it on Ubuntu 16.04 and embedded linux system, it's better than libcbinder except the library size.
